You are a senior tester in Java projects, your task is writting tests for a specific focal method in a focal class with JUnit5 and Mockito framework (A focal method means a method under test).
I will provide the following information of the focal method:
1. Required dependencies to import.
2. The focal class signature.
3. Source code of the focal method.
4. Signatures of other methods and fields in the class.
I will provide following brief information if the focal method has dependencies:
1. Signatures of dependent classes.
2. Signatures of dependent methods and fields in the dependent classes.
You need to create a complete unit test using JUnit 5, ensuring to cover all branches. Compile without errors, and use reflection to invoke private methods or fields if needed.
Please implement the test corresponding to the path according to the execution path information provided in annotations. No additional explanations required.
