Here's an optimized version of your FTL template, designed to ensure that the output is strictly formatted as JSON and adheres to the provided sample structure. I've included additional clarity for each section to guide the LLM in producing the desired output.

```ftl
<#-- Begin by defining the method and class information -->
<#-- This section will be replaced with the provided method signature and class name -->
${method_sig} within the focal class ${class_name}

<#-- This section will be replaced with the full source code of the class -->
${full_fm}

<#-- List of dependent classes and their brief information -->
<#list c_deps as key, value>
    Brief information about the dependent class ${key} is as follows:
    ```
    ${value}
    ```
</#list>

<#-- List of dependent methods and their brief information -->
<#list m_deps as key, value>
    Brief information about the dependent method ${key} is as follows:
    ```
    ${value}
    ```
</#list>

<#-- Instructions for decomposing the method into slices -->
### Instructions on Decomposing the Method under Test into Slices

1. Summarize the focal method.
2. List the test environment settings required for running the focal method, including:
- Enumerate all input parameters and object/class fields invoked in the focal method that need to be set or mocked.
- Enumerate all object/class methods invoked in the focal method that need to be set or mocked.
3. Important Note! Please decompose the solution program into multiple problem-solving steps according to the semantics. Each step should represent a slice of the method under test and accomplish a subtask.
- Slices can be hierarchical.
- Your analysis has two parts:
a. Describe the subtask of the slice.
b. Replicate the corresponding original code statements.
4. Organize the hierarchical slices into a reformatted structure.
- For example, if we have 4 slices A, B, C, and D. Slice A contains slice B and slice C, and slice D are siblings of slice A. Reformat them as follows:
{slice A}.{slice B}: {description of the subtask to accomplish in the reformat} {corresponding original code statements}
{slice A}.{slice C}: {description of the subtask to accomplish in the reformat} {corresponding original code statements}
{slice D}: {description of the subtask to accomplish in the reformat} {corresponding original code statements}

### Format of the Output

The output must strictly adhere to the following JSON format:

```json
{
"summarization": "...",
"//": "Local variables defined in the focal method should not be reported.",
"invoked_outside_vars": [
"input_str: string, input parameter, the input string to handle",
"code.format: public string, public class field of object 'code' of class Encoding, representing the format to encode the input string",
"..."
],
"invoked_outside_methods": [
"parser.norm(string): public member method of object 'parser' of class 'Parser', responsible for normalizing the input string",
"..."
],
"steps": [
{
"desp": "Initialization and setup\n    - Initialize an empty list of tokens.\n    - Initialize a boolean flag `eatTheRest` to false.",
"code": "    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; tokens = new List();\n boolean eatTheRest = false;\n"
},
{
"desp": "...",
"code": "..."
},
...
]
}
```

<#-- End of FTL template -->
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Clarity in Instructions**: I've clarified the instructions to make it easier for the LLM to follow.
2. **Strict JSON Adherence**: Emphasized that the output must strictly follow the JSON format, aligning with the provided sample.
3. **Comments for Understanding**: Added comments to guide the LLM on how to fill in the template appropriately.

This should help in generating the structured output you need for unit testing your method effectively.
