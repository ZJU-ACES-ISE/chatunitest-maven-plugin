Hello! Thank you for reaching out for assistance in fixing the unit test. I'll provide you with the failed unit test, the error report, and then guide you through the steps to fix the issues. Finally, I'll share examples of well-structured unit tests.

# Unit Test to Fix

Here's the unit test that needs fixing. To help you locate the error statements, I provide the line numbers.

```java
${unit_test}
```
The error encountered when running this unit test is:

```
${error_message}
```

# Procedures for Fixing the Unit Test:
Let's proceed step by step:

1. Pick out the statements that the errors occur.
2. Explain the causes of the errors.
3. Give solutions on how to fix the errors.
4. Provide the complete fixed unit test, utilizing JUnit 5.

# Requirements and Considerations for the Unit Test Fix:
- Ensure the unit tests are executable without compile errors, runtime errors, or timeouts.
- Aim for high coverage scores, covering as many instructions and branches of the method under test as possible.
- Avoid modifying the method under test.
- Generate the entire unit test file, including package declaration and imports.
- Ensure correct testing of the method under test:
- The method under test is defined in ${class_name}.
- The method under test is ${class_name}.${method_name}.
- Utilize correct tools and adhere to Java 8 language style:
- You can use JUnit 5.
- The language style should follow Java 8 conventions.
- DO NOT generate line numbers.

# Output Format
To facilitate generating the desired unit test, follow these instructions:

< Generation Begin >
## 1. Pick out the statements with errors:
...

## 2. Explain the causes of the errors
...

## 3. Give solutions to the errors
...

## 4. Provide the complete fixed unit test

```java
...
```
< Generation Over >

Please proceed with generating the fixed unit test.
Ensure all generations are provided in a single response.
Ensure your generation contains NO line numbers!
